# Sorting Visualizer

## Description

This project aims to take a unique approach to the popular personal project that is a sorting algorithm visualizer. While most visualizers display sorting via bars of varying height, this one aims to visualize sorting by using randomly asorted colored spheres and sorting them into a rainbow type pattern. The colors are generated via HSL (Hue Saturation Lighting) and with the hue numbered from 1 to 286. Following an algorithm, all sphere will be sorted in ascending order (red to violet). Enjoy and feel free to use the code to try and build your own sorting algorithms... I am planning on adding merge sort and quick sort soon

## Note

Setting the speed to the maximum setting may cause your browser to lag and not display spheres cleanly
